In a digital age, it's unjust to marginalize this substantial demographic based on abilities.

This talk emphasizes the critical role of accessibility in mobile apps. By introducing the innovative use of Gemini AI as an AI-powered code assistance tool in IDEs, we can address these issues head-on, ensuring that apps are accessible from the outset. Gemini AI serves as a game-changer, automating the detection and correction of accessibility issues in Flutter apps.

      It is possible to run iOS/IPadOS apps created with Flutter on Apple Vision Pro / Vision OS.
      However, there are restrictions, such as the aspect ratio being fixed.
  Flutter is good at creating responsive apps that allow you to freely change the aspect ratio like a web browser.
  If this limitation can be removed, Flutter will be a very good option as a tool for creating Vision OS applications.
  The way to get rid of this limitation is to run Flutter apps as Vision OS apps instead of iOS/IPadOS apps, in other words, add Vision OS support to Flutter.
      There are currently issues regarding this issue, but no progress has been made toward a resolution.
  So I decided to try this problem.
  In this session, I will present the current state of Flutter for Vision OS, the issues that need to be solved in order to add support for Vision OS to Flutter, and my efforts to solve the issues.

In my product, the failure rate is high, and I needed a mechanism to detect and solve the problems as early as possible. So I adapted the SLI/SLO mechanism to fit mobile apps and created a mechanism to detect poor user experience. This mechanism allows for immediate detection of the following.
- Failure rate (cases where a certain number of users fail to use a feature due to an error or other occurrence)
- Cancellation rate (cases where a certain number of users cancel for some reason when using a feature)
- Suspension rate (cases where a certain number of users kill the app for some reason when using a feature)

Our app has now been embedded in more than 40 features for this monitoring.
In this session, we will discuss the following.
- What is SLI/SLO
- The difference between SLI/SLO in general and SLI/SLO for user experience detection
- How to measure cases where a user stops using a feature or crashes in the middle of a feature
- How to set the sampling rate
- How to create a user experience alerting infrastructure How to combat noise alerts when creating them
- How to embed the measurement infrastructure with as little impact on the main code as possible

Understanding how widget tree works is crucial to enhancing the quality of our apps.

Yet, developers often explore options beyond the widget tree, such as using packages for state management, to address the challenges in development. While depending on external packages quickly solves our problems, it also introduces risks or costs of complexity and fear of breaking changes.

This session aims to demystify the widget tree's capabilities, revealing how it can solve everyday challenges.

I will start by taking a closer look at the widget tree's mechanism. After that, I will explain how the Flutter framework and each widget use it internally. Finally, the session will end with the main discussion of how we can maximize the mechanism's potential.

After listening to this session, you will be able to

- Efficiently manage styling and state
- Design your widgets to be more portable and testable
- Reduce needless dependencies on packages
- Easily understand Flutter docs
